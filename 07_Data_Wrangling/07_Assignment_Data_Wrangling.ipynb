    "Question 5 is a three parter that requires you to use the output of the 1st part to complete the 2nd and the output of the 2nd part to complete the third. At the bottom of this notebook, I've put down the answers to parts 1 and 2 - so if you get stuck on one part you still have the input you need for the next one. We covered the sentiment analysis stuff pretty quickly in class, but everything you need for reference should be covered in the in_class_exercises file. \n",

It's not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named. Now Harry Potter is faced with the unreliability of the very government of the magical world and the impotence of the authorities at Hogwarts. Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable sacrifice.

It's not just the upcoming O.W.L. exams; a new teacher with a personality like poisoned honey; a venomous, disgruntled house-elf; or even the growing threat of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.

Despite this (or perhaps because of it), he finds depth and strength in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty; and unbearable sacrifice.
